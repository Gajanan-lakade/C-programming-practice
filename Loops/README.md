# Basics of C Programming

This folder contains C programs demonstrating different types of looping statements.
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.

## Programs Included

- `for_loop.c`  
  Demonstrates the use of a **for loop** to print numbers from num to 1.

- `while_loop.c`  
  Demonstrates the use of a **while loop** where the condition is checked before execution.

- `do_while_loop.c`  
  Demonstrates the use of a **do-while loop**, which executes the loop body at least once.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Loop initialization
- Loop condition
- Increment / decrement
- Difference between while and do-while loop

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
gcc filename.c
./a.out
