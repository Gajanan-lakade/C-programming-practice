# Strings in C Programming

This folder contains basic programs demonstrating how strings work in C.
A string in C is a sequence of characters stored in a character array and
terminated by a null character (`\0`).

## Programs Included
- `string_example.c` – Demonstrates string declaration, input using `scanf()`, and output
- `string_input_fgets.c` – Demonstrates string input using `fgets()` to read full lines with spaces

## Key Concepts Covered
- What is a string in C
- Character arrays
- Null terminator (`\0`)
- String input using `scanf()`
- String input using `fgets()`
- Printing strings using `printf()`

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
gcc filename.c
./a.out
